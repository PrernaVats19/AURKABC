**Description of Data Used:** Lung cancer–specific resource aggregating gene-expression data and rigorously curated clinical annotations from >6,700 patients across 56 studies, spanning 23 genome‑wide expression platforms. Sources include GEO, TCGA, and individual published studies. Data are harmonized and quality‑controlled to enable cross‑study analyses.

**Key Analyses / Modules Used:**

* **Tumor vs. Normal Meta‑analysis** for differential expression (outputs include standardized mean differences with forest plots).
* **Survival Meta‑analysis** for gene expression–survival associations across studies (hazard ratios with 95% CI and forest plots).
* **Individual Dataset Survival Analysis** with flexible dichotomization cutoffs (median, mean, cluster, custom) and Kaplan–Meier plots.
* **Comparative Analysis** across clinical subgroups.
* **Co‑expression / Correlation Analysis** for gene–gene relationships.

**Key Parameters / Filters Applied (examples):**

* Gene‑level queries by official gene symbol (HGNC).
* Lung cancer subtype selection: All, Adenocarcinoma (LUAD/ADC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC/SCC).
* Clinicopathological subgrouping (where available in datasets): stage (I–IV), smoking status, sex, adjuvant therapy, mutation status, etc.
* Cutoff strategy for survival analysis: median, mean, cluster‑based (Gaussian mixture), or user‑defined threshold.
* Dataset/platform inclusion options and study‑level filters.

**Outputs Collected:** Kaplan–Meier curves, hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals, p‑values, standardized mean differences (SMD), and forest plots summarizing meta‑analytic results.
