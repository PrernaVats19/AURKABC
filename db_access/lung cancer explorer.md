# Lung Cancer Explorer (LCE) Database Information

* **Full Database Name:** Lung Cancer Explorer (LCE)
**Version / Build Used:** Website build noted as 2017 (site footer); reference publication: *Oncogene* 2018 (issue 2019)
**Access Date(s):** 02-09-2025
**URL:** [https://lce.biohpc.swmed.edu/lungcancer/](https://lce.biohpc.swmed.edu/lungcancer/)
**Description of Data Used:** Lung cancer–specific resource aggregating gene-expression data and rigorously curated clinical annotations from >6,700 patients across 56 studies, spanning 23 genome‑wide expression platforms. Sources include GEO, TCGA, and individual published studies. Data are harmonized and quality‑controlled to enable cross‑study analyses.
**Key Analyses / Modules Used:**
* **Tumor vs. Normal Meta‑analysis** for differential expression (outputs include standardized mean differences with forest plots).
**Key Parameters / Filters Applied (examples):**
* Gene‑level queries by official gene symbol (HGNC).
* Lung cancer subtype selection: All, Adenocarcinoma (LUAD/ADC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC/SCC).
* Clinicopathological subgrouping (where available in datasets): stage (I–IV), smoking status, sex, adjuvant therapy, mutation status, etc.
* Cutoff strategy for survival analysis: median, mean, cluster‑based (Gaussian mixture), or user‑defined threshold.
* Dataset/platform inclusion options and study‑level filters.
